# Tech Journey: From Phenom 300 Captain to Software & Cloud ✈️☁️

Hi, I’m Jessica!  

After a decade as a pilot, currently Captain on a Phenom 300, I’m now on a new course — this time into the world of programming and cloud technology.  
I’m still at the beginning, but I remember what it felt like when I first started flying — overwhelming at first, but with persistence and curiosity, I thrived. I know I can do it again.

This repository is the foundation of my tech journey — a place to track my projects, learning milestones, and progress.
